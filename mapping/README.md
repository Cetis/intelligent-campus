# Intelligent Campus Mapping Ontology

The Intelligent Campus Mapping ontology is a simple flat ontology of entities that map to Open Street Map keys or tags (a combination of keys and properties). The ontology is split into two types of entitiess, items (that can be mapped to OSM TAGS) and properties (that can be mapped to OSM keys)

## Rationale
The HE service point ontology is based upon [OpenStreetMap tags](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags) and where possible a link to an Open Street Map key (typically for properties in the vocab) OR key:value pair (typically for items in the vocab) will be supplied. Where there is no suitable Open Street Map key or keypair pair, a wikidata entry will be provided.


### Notes on Open Street Maps

- Open street maps has 3 types of entities, these are
    - nodes (defining points in space),
    - ways (defining linear features and area boundaries), and
    - relations (which are sometimes used to explain how other elements work together).
