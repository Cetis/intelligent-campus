# Jisc's Intelligent Campus: Data Specifications

_Version 0.1 is a development version, not yet formally released._

## Introduction
This repository, currently a work-in-progress, contains the data specifications for [Jisc's Intelligent Campus R&D project](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/intelligent-campus). The [repository's Wiki](https://github.com/Cetis/intelligent-campus/wiki) contains descriptions of the data and information requirements work for non-technical staff. Technical staff may also find the Wiki helpful for context.

## Information model

A good starting point for addressing the data specifications is to have a look at our [information model diagram](https://github.com/Cetis/intelligent-campus/blob/master/InformationModel.png). This diagram describes the context of the technical specifications.

## Specification development workflow
The simplest way to contribute to the Jisc Intelligent Campus data specifications is as follows:

1. Add an issue to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Cetis/intelligent-campus/issues) to alert everyone to what you are working on and why.
2. Make an edit or add a file in this repository and save it to your own branch. If you prefer, you can fork the whole repository and work in your own version.
3. Send a pull request once you're done.
4. The change will be discussed by our team and either merged, or kept in the queue, depending on whether more work is required.

You can do all this through the Github GUI, but you're welcome to use any other git tool you prefer.
